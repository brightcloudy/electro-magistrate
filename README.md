# electro-magistrate
Chatware suite automating cross-chat bridging, moderation, movie nights and more.


I wrote this software in December 2018. I was unemployed at the time, and living in Michigan, and very eager to get myself a better job somewhere else.
I figured the best bet was to get really good at writing web applications in Node.
Anyway, I did get a job in California in 2019, but it was not writing web applications in Node.

The thing that this software did (and still does) is help a lot of my friends talk to each other online. This makes me feel good.
